\description{
This is the master function for meta-analyses of \emph{d} values - it facilitates the computation of bare-bones, artifact-distribution, and individual-correction meta-analyses of correlations for any number of group-wise contrasts and any number of dependent variables.
When artifact-distribution meta-analyses are performed, this function will automatically extract the artifact information from a database and organize it into the requested type of artifact distribution object (i.e., either Taylor series or interactive artifact distributions).
This function is also equipped with the capability to clean databases containing inconsistently recorded artifact data, impute missing artifacts (when individual-correction meta-analyses are requested), and remove dependency among samples by forming composites or averaging effect sizes and artifacts.
The automatic compositing features are employed when \code{sample_id}s and/or construct names are provided.
When multiple meta-analyses are computed within this program, the result of this function takes on the class \code{ma_master}, which means that it is a list of meta-analyses. Follow-up analyses (e.g., sensitivity, heterogeneity, meta-regression) performed on \code{ma_master} objects will analyze data from all meta-analyses recorded in the object.

\examples{
## The 'ma_d' function can compute multi-construct bare-bones meta-analyses:
ma_d(d = d, n1 = n1, n2 = n2, construct_y = construct, data = data_d_meas_multi)

## It can also perform multiple individual-correction meta-analyses:
ma_d(ma_method = "ic", d = d, n1 = n1, n2 = n2, ryy = ryyi,
     construct_y = construct, data = data_d_meas_multi)

## And 'ma_d' can also curate artifact distributions and compute multiple
## artifact-distribution meta-analyses:
ma_d(ma_method = "ad", d = d, n1 = n1, n2 = n2,
     ryy = ryyi, correct_rr_y = FALSE,
     construct_y = construct, data = data_d_meas_multi)
