\title{Correct correlations for measurement error}
\usage{
correct_r_meas(rxy, rxx = 1, ryy = 1, n = NULL, conf_level = 0.95,
  correct_bias = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rxy}{Vector of observed correlations.}

\item{rxx}{Vector of reliability coefficients for X.}

\item{ryy}{Vector of reliability coefficients for Y.}

\item{n}{Optional vector of sample sizes associated with the rxy correlations.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level to define the width of the confidence interval (default = .95).}

\item{correct_bias}{Logical argument that determines whether to correct error-variance estimates for small-sample bias in correlations (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).
For sporadic corrections (e.g., in mixed artifact-distribution meta-analyses), this should be set to \code{FALSE}, the default).}
}
\value{
Data frame(s) of observed correlations (\code{rxy}), operational correlations corrected for measurement error in Y only (\code{rxp}), operational correlations corrected for measurement error in X only (\code{rty}), and true-score correlations (\code{rtp}).
