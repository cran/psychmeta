\title{Correct for small-sample bias in Cohen's \emph{d} values}
\usage{
correct_d_bias(d, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Vector of Cohen's d values.}

\item{n}{Vector of sample sizes.}
}
\value{
Vector of d values corrected for small-sample bias.
}
\description{
Corrects a vector of Cohen's \emph{d} values for small-sample bias, as Cohen's \emph{d} has a slight positive bias.
}
\details{
The bias correction is estimated as:

\deqn{d_{c}=\frac{d_{obs}}{1+\frac{.75}{n-3}}}{d_c = d / (1 + .75 / (n - 3))}

where \eqn{d_{obs}}{d} is the observed effect size, \eqn{d_{c}}{d_c} is the corrected estimate of \emph{d}, and \emph{n} is the total sample size.
}
\examples{
correct_d_bias(d = .3, n = 30)
correct_d_bias(d = .3, n = 300)
correct_d_bias(d = .3, n = 3000)
